# Book-Recommendation-System

This project is an easy to use application meant to be installed on bookstore computers, aiming to assist customers in selecting books that best match their individual preferences and criteria. Users can specify various parameters such as their age, maximum price, genre interests, and other preferences. The system evaluates the bookstore's collection of books, calculating a suitability grade for each based on the user's input. It dynamically adjusts the selection process according to user feedback. The goal is to make the book selection process more efficient and personalized. The main feature of the project is the fuzzy string matching algorithm that compares user input with a pre-defined list of keywords (one for every major genre of books), accounting for close matches and misspellings to better identify user interests.
